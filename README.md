# Test Driven Development with Node, Mocha and Chai

Project Description / Instructions

* Create a new repo named tdd-strict-equal in GitHub and make your instructor a collaborator
* Once your instructor has pushed you code, clone your repo locally
* Create a new branch named answer to do your work in
* You will be creating a strictEquals() function utilizing a test driven development approach
* The function will return true if the values provided are strictly equal to each other, for example, strictEquals('5', 5) will return false you must do this without using JavaScript's === operator
* Start by creating you tests which will assert the correct behavior of the function, commit these to your branch first
* Next you will implement the function so that your tests pass
* Commit your changes, push your branch up to GitHub, and create a pull request
* Request review from the instructor on your PR
